## Palace

Palace, probably should have been called the playground, because thats essentially what this site, and project is. I just wanna learn, and if i can make something that helps people in the process, that would be awesome.

### The Octogon

The Octogon, is a simple planter, for 4 plants. The design, is small and desktoppable. There are four quadrants, for water, so its basically self watering. At least for awhile.
