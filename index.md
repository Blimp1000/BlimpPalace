## Palace

Palace, probably should have been called the playground, because thats essentially what this site, and project is. I just wanna learn, and if i can make something that helps people in the process, that would be awesome.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Blimp1000/Palace/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
